##Welcome to my Note Taking Application!

I was very excited about this opportunity and wanted to get in my take home as soon
as possible!

To run this application, once downloaded, run
```
  tar -zxvf josh.tar.gz
```

Change into the directory where it was extraced and either run

```
npm install
```

or 

```
yarn
```

After the dependencies are installed you can run

```
npm start
```

or

```
yarn start
```

Which will start the application on localhost:3000 and open up a browser window for you.

To run the test suites simply run

```
npm run test
```

or 

```
yarn test
```

I built this Note Taking application with React and Redux.  Given some more time other
things that I was considering that I really enjoy would be Redux-Saga as well as to use
Normalizr.

Thank you so much for taking the time to take a look at it and I hope we get to talk about it
in the near future!

Thanks,

Josh Horwitz
